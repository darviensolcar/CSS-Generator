# CSS Theme Variation Generator

A powerful Python tool that analyzes existing CSS themes and generates cohesive variations that maintain the original design language and vibe. Perfect for creating theme families with consistent visual identity!

## 🎨 What It Does

Takes your existing CSS themes and creates **intelligent variations** that:
- ✅ Maintain the original design vibe and feel
- ✅ Use harmonious color adjustments
- ✅ Keep consistent spacing and typography
- ✅ Generate both light and dark versions
- ✅ Create unique but related theme families

## 🌟 Key Features

### Intelligent Analysis
- **Color Extraction** - Analyzes all color values from your theme
- **Typography Detection** - Understands font choices and scales
- **Spacing Recognition** - Maintains consistent spacing patterns
- **Border Analysis** - Preserves border radius and style preferences
- **Shadow Detection** - Keeps shadow depth and intensity
- **Animation Patterns** - Maintains timing and easing preferences

### Smart Variation Strategies

The generator uses **6 different variation techniques**:

1. **Color Shift** 🎨
   - Subtle hue adjustments (±5-15 degrees)
   - Maintains color harmony
   - Creates related but distinct palettes

2. **Blend** 🔀
   - Mixes characteristics from two themes
   - Creates hybrid designs
   - Maintains both parents' DNA

3. **Complementary** 🎭
   - Uses opposite colors on the color wheel
   - Creates high contrast variations
   - Bold and striking results

4. **Analogous** 🌈
   - Uses adjacent colors on the color wheel
   - Harmonious and pleasant combinations
   - Natural color progression

5. **Monochromatic** 🎼
   - Same hue, different saturation/lightness
   - Sophisticated and unified look
   - Elegant variations

6. **Subtle** ✨
   - Minimal adjustments
   - Refined micro-variations
   - Polish and perfection

### Creative Naming System

Each variation gets a unique, professional name:
- "Enhanced Desert Vision 1"
- "Modern Zephyr Edition 2"
- "Peak Collection Variant 3.5"
- "Refined Ocean Bloom 4"

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Existing CSS themes (generated by `css_generator.py`)
- No external dependencies!

## 🚀 Installation

1. Make sure you have `css_generator.py` and have generated at least one theme
2. Place `theme_variation_generator.py` in the same directory
3. You're ready to go!

## 💻 Usage

### Step 1: Generate Base Themes

First, create your base themes using the CSS Generator:

```bash
python css_generator.py
```

This creates themes in the `generated_themes/` directory.

### Step 2: Run the Variation Generator

```bash
python theme_variation_generator.py
```

### Step 3: Follow the Interactive Prompts

The script will:

1. **Show available designs:**
```
Found 4 design(s) with 8 theme file(s):

  1. Desert Vision (2 files)
  2. Modern Zephyr (2 files)
  3. Peak Collection (2 files)
  4. Ocean Bloom (2 files)

Select a design number (or press Enter to use the first design):
```

2. **Ask for variation count:**
```
How many variations would you like to create?
Enter a number from 1 to 10: 5
```

3. **Generate variations:**
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Creating Theme Families
Generate multiple related themes for:
- Multi-brand websites
- White-label products
- Client variations
- A/B testing

### 2. Exploring Design Options
Quickly create variations to:
- Find the perfect color balance
- Test different moods
- Present options to clients
- Explore design directions

### 3. Seasonal Themes
Create seasonal variations:
- Spring (lighter, fresher)
- Summer (brighter, vibrant)
- Fall (warmer, earthy)
- Winter (cooler, crisp)

### 4. Brand Evolution
Evolve your design gradually:
- Subtle iterations
- Progressive refinement

- Test new directions

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Analysis Phase
```python
# Extracts design patterns from your CSS
colors = extract_colors()          # All color values
typography = extract_typography()  # Font choices & scales
spacing = extract_spacing()        # Spacing system
borders = extract_borders()        # Border styles
shadows = extract_shadows()        # Shadow definitions
animations = extract_animations()  # Timing & easing
```

### 2. Variation Phase
```python
# Creates intelligent variations
new_colors = adjust_colors(strategy='analogous')
new_spacing = scale_spacing(multiplier=1.1)
new_borders = refine_borders()
```

### 3. Generation Phase
```python
# Generates complete CSS files
generate_css(colors, typography, spacing, ...)
# Creates both light and dark versions
```

## 🔧 Advanced Tips

### Getting Specific Results

**For subtle variations (refinements):**
```bash
# Run multiple times, select variations you like
python theme_variation_generator.py
# Input: 3 variations
# Pick the best from multiple runs
```

**For bold variations (exploration):**
```bash
# The generator randomly uses different strategies
# Complementary and analogous create bolder changes
# Run several times for variety
```

**For blended themes:**
```bash
# Make sure you have at least 2 different base designs
# The generator will automatically blend them
```

### Organizing Variations

Create a directory structure:
```
themes/
├── base/
│   └── desert-vision-light.css
├── variations/
│   ├── spring/
│   │   └── desert-vision-edition-1-light.css
│   ├── summer/
│   │   └── desert-vision-edition-2-light.css
│   └── fall/
│       └── desert-vision-edition-3-light.css
```

### Using in Projects

**Option 1: Link in HTML**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="variations/desert-vision-edition-1-light.css">
```

**Option 2: Theme Switcher**
```javascript
function loadThemeVariation(variation) {
    const link = document.getElementById('theme-css');
    link.href = `variations/desert-vision-${variation}-light.css`;
}
```

**Option 3: Build Process**
```javascript
// Combine base + variation for custom builds
const base = readFile('base-theme.css');
const variation = readFile('variation-1.css');
const combined = merge(base, variation);
```

## 📊 Statistics

Each run provides detailed information:
- Number of variations generated
- Variation types used
- File locations
- Color strategy breakdown

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Start with quality base themes** - Better input = better output
2. **Generate multiple batches** - Try different numbers (3, 5, 7, 10)
3. **Test variations in context** - See how they look in your actual UI
4. **Mix and match** - Combine elements from different variations
5. **Keep organized** - Use clear naming and folder structure
6. **Document your favorites** - Note which variations work best

## 🚨 Limitations

- Variations are based on mathematical color adjustments
- Some combinations may need manual tweaking
- Semantic meaning of colors is not preserved (e.g., error colors might shift)
- Very complex custom CSS may not be fully captured
- Generated variations include variable definitions but not all component styles

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

See `TODO.md` for planned features:
- Semantic color preservation
- Custom variation rules
- Visual preview generator
- Batch processing
- Export to other formats

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Color Harmony
- Use base themes with already harmonious colors
- The better the input, the better the variations
- Consider color theory when selecting base themes

### Consistency
- Generate all variations in one session for consistency
- Use the same base theme for a cohesive family
- Keep spacing and typography consistent

### Testing
- Test variations across different screen sizes
- Check both light and dark themes
- Verify accessibility (contrast ratios)
- Get feedback from real users

## 🤝 Workflow Integration

### With Design Tools
1. Generate variations
2. Import into Figma/Sketch for review
3. Refine manually if needed
4. Export final versions

### With Build Systems
1. Generate during build process
